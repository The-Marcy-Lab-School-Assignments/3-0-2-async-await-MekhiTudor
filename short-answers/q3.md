# Question

Will the code work? Why or why not?

```js
const getUsers = async () => {
  const url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users";
  const users = await fetch(url)
    .then((r) => r.json())
    .catch((err) => []);
  console.log(users);
  return users;
};
getUsers();
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer

Yes this code will work because we are waiting for the data from the `url` given. If we have a valid `url` it will `return` our data in a readable format. then it will use that data to `console.log` all of our users, otherwise (our catch) we will `return` an empty array IF the `url` is invalid.
