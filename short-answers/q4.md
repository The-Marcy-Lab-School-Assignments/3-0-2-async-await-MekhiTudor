# Question

Is this function safe? Why or why not?

```js
const getUser = async (userId) => {
  const url = `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${userId}`;
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const users = await response.json();
  console.log(users);
  return users;
};
getUser(-1);
```

Again, running the code gives you the answer, so try to figure it out on your own first!

# Answer

I think the only problem with this code is the argument given to it, otherwise I think the code is safe.

# Teacher Feedback

Not quite. What is missing from this code that we need to make sure we stop it from running in case of a bad argument?
